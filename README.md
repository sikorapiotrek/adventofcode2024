Advent of Code - Solutions Repository

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository!
This is my very first repository, and I’m super excited to share my journey of solving the Advent of Code challenges. Here, you'll find my solutions to the coding puzzles that make up this annual event.

What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an annual set of programming puzzles that run from December 1st to December 25th. Each day presents a new puzzle, ranging in difficulty and covering a variety of programming concepts. It's a great way to practice coding, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking!

About This Repository
Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a day of the challenge, structured like this:

├── day1
│   ├── challenge1.py
│   └── challenge2.py
├── day2
│   ├── challenge1.py
│   └── challenge2.py
...
challenge1.py: Solution for the first puzzle of the day.
challenge2.py: Solution for the second puzzle of the day.

Programming Language
I’m solving the challenges using Python. If you're new to coding, my solutions might help you understand how to approach problems step by step.
